# Ello-Button

The Ello button is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app that serves up an SVG icon for your website that will link to your Ello profile. [The Ello button is located within the WTF app](https://ello.co/wtf/resources/ello-button/) and is very simple to use -- just type in your username, choose your color, and copy & paste the code into your page's HTML.
